## AI-2 Prompt
>  I want to generate a CSS file inspired by the Apple WWDC 2023 image from Apple.com for my portfolio website. The file should feature a modern, responsive design that incorporates the colors, textures, and overall mood of the image. The CSS should include clear comments explaining key styles and be structured to style the Navigation bar, Header/Intro, About Me, Education, Projects, Contact Form, and Footer. 
> 
> The image should be creatively integrated as a hero section background, a text mask for headings, section dividers, and as a pattern or texture element. The design should include smooth transitions, interactive elements, and a balance between readability and aesthetics. It should utilize Flexbox, Grid, and other modern CSS techniques to ensure functionality across both mobile and desktop. 
> 
> Placeholder or generic styling should be avoided, with each design element purposefully crafted based on the imageâ€™s aesthetic. Accessibility should also be prioritized to maintain usability and visual appeal.
