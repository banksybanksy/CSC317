# After the Credits Submission

**After the Credits** is a collaborative full-stack web application developed by our team for Assignment 5 in CSC 317. The site allows users to search for movies, explore metadata like genres and directors, and curate a personal watchlist. The backend is powered by Express.js and MongoDB Atlas, while the frontend is rendered through server-side views and styled for responsive usability.

## Backend & Deployment Notes
Working as the Backend Lead, I was primarily responsible for implementing the routing logic, database integration, and deployment via Render. One of the more challenging aspects was getting MongoDB Atlas and Render to work smoothly together—especially handling environment variables and managing app startup delays. 

We built out numerous routes for features like movie search, user authentication, watchlist handling, and API-driven suggestions. There were also a few bumps in team coordination—particularly around how our Data & Coordination member handled merging and formatting—but clear communication and scoped responsibilities helped get things back on track.

## Team Reflection
We overcame a few roadblocks around data formatting and API response handling, especially while syncing backend expectations with frontend rendering. Some merge conflicts and coordination delays occurred with our Data & Coordination team member, but these were ultimately resolved through clearer task ownership and refactoring support.

This project tested both our technical and collaborative skills, and we’re proud of the final outcome.
